# Why the possible name of Cosmic?

One of the colors I use is [Cosmic Latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte "Wikipedia entry for cosmic latte."), which is the average color of the universe. I also wanted to make a light and dark version of this color scheme. The time when the first stars began to form is called the [Cosmic Dawn](https://phys.org/news/2021-09-cosmic-dawn-astronomy-greatest.html "Cosmic Dawn article from the phys.org.") I thought this sounded like a good name and then I could have four versions of my colorscheme: Night, Dawn, Day, Dusk. This could change though.

## Why make a colorscheme?

The fundamental answer is - why not? There are plently of colorschemes that I like. I stuck with [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox "Gruvbox theme by morhetz") for a long time but recently started to enjoy [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme "Dracula theme by zenorocha"), [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme "Tokyo Night theme by enkia"), [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord "Nord theme by arcticicestudio"), and [Palenight](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme "Palenight theme by equinusocio").

The problem with these themes is that they're not *mine*. I like each for one reason or another but each has tweaks that I made. So, why not start from scratch and have something that I created and can make it exactly what I want.

# Why these colors?

One of the issues I have with the other colorschemes is the contrast of the foreground text. Often it is harsh but is occasionally to dim or to similar to the other colors. My preference is for something off-white like in Gruvbox.

At some point, by chance, I came across the color Cosmic Latte. I started using this color as my foreground because it's bright, is a less harsh off-white, and is just neat. The idea of using the average color of the Universe makes what I create seem more important (or at least I like to think so).

# Why is it currently only in HTML/CSS?

For right now, the easiest way for me to visualize everything was to just make some squares. There is the added benefit that [Github Pages](https://coolhwhipmike.github.io/colorscheme/ "A temporary preview of my colorscheme.") can be used to quickly see the colorscheme with adding images to the repo. I'll eventually do that once I get some colors that are a little more certain.
